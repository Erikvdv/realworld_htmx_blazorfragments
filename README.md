# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### [Dotnet 8] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a frontend application built with **[Dotnet 8]** and **[HTMX]** using a minimal api approach with blazor fragments

A live example can be found [here](https://blazorhtmx.azurewebsites.net/)

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Dotnet 8]** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
